This is worth bearing in mind, especially when you have some knowledge of the underlying system. Here, we know that sensors are noisy, but what we really want to do is avoid the walls - so looking at minimum distances makes sense. In other cases, it may be worth introducing a quadratic term to capture physical relationships (for example, given mass and velocity as features, finding mv^2 to capture some energy related relationship might help) or just simplifying sets of related features. There are few hard and fast rules for feature engineering - it's an area where experience and luck still play a major role in finding ones that work."
